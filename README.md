# NeRFusion: Towards Understanding Diffusion and NeRF in Spatial Computing _(WIP)_

Exploring diffusion with natural language and editable neural radiance fields (NeRF) in 3D reconstructed environments towards understanding applications in human-robot interaction and spatial computing.

Urban scenarios will be used to expand on current literature on Diminished Reality using ubiquitous sensor networks to perform novel view synthesis and make city walls and buildings see-through.

## Work in progress: Please keep checking back for updates!
